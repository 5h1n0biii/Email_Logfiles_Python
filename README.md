# How to use

1. Change SMTP settings in the script to preferred settings of your email service, just ask ChatGPT for your smtp address and your port (for example for Outlook it is `smtp.office365.com` and port is `587`)
2. The `logfiles.txt` will be stored in `Users\Documents`. Edit code for Linux usage or to use another directory for the `logfiles.txt`.
3. Feel free to combine this code with whatever function you like to fill the .txt, for example a keylogger with an automated script start function (*But do not use it for illegal activities in any sort! Only use it for educational purposes! I will not provide any keylogging or other potentially harmful code here!*)
